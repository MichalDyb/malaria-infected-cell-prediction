# malaria-infected-cell-prediction

The aim of the project was to create a learning network model 
based on a data set consisting of photos of healthy cells and 
cells infected with malaria.

This project was created with:
* Python, 
* Keras, 
* TensorFlow, 
* Scikit-learn, 
* NumPy, 
* Matplotlib, 
* Seaborn, 
* PIL.


The model's task is to distinguish between healthy cells and 
malaria-infected cells on the basis of the provided photos of
the cells.

The easiest way to run the code would be to install anaconda distribution.

The training data set was downloaded from the website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria

!!! Only a small part of the data set is included in the repository.
